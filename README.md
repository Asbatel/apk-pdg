# Welcome to Apk-pdg

Androguard-based framework to create a Program Dependence Graph of an Android application (apk) and export it into a graph format.

# Program Dependence Graph

- A graph that explicitly considers both data and control dependences. The data dependence represents the program’s appropriate data flow whereas the control dependence illustrates the program’s control flow relationships.
- The combination of both dependences covers all the program’s computational parts, which leads to an efficient program’s optimization. 

# PDG Topology 

- Program Dependence Graph’s nodes are represented as *Basic Blocks* while the edges represent both the data values and control conditions necessary to the execution of the node’s operations.
- It is constructed from the *Androguard Analysis Object* and then converted into a *Networkx DiGraph*. The current supported format is *gpickle*.

# Requirements

The construction process depends on the following tool:

   - **Androguard**: It is used for statically analyzing the target APK and extracting its contextual and structural data. (https://github.com/androguard/androguard)
    
# Installation and Usage

   1. Download or clone the repo (git clone https://github.com/Asbatel/apk-pdg.git)
   2. Install **Androguard** (latest version)
   3. Navigate to the main directory: `cd pdg/`
   4. Run the following command: `python get_graph.py <apk_path>`
